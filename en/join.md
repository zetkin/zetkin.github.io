## Organize activism
Zetkin is a tool to help you improve your organization's activism. Zetkin's
promise is to make participation simple and improve the efficiency of
common organizer tasks.

## Doing it together
The development of Zetkin is funded by donations and by subscription fees paid
by connected organizations. As more of us discover and start using Zetkin, costs
and prices go down.

## Who can use Zetkin?
Zetkin Foundation's mission is to work towards radical change of society in a
socialist, feminist, antiracist and sustainabile direction. To be able to use
Zetkin, your organization's work must be compatible with this goal. If you are
unsure, please contact us!
